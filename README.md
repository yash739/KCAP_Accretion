# KCAP_Accretion
2025 KCAP Project Repo to contain mentees' progress reports and outputs

## Abstract

Accretion is a fundamental process by which gravitational potential energy gets reprocessed into light of various wavelengths, with kinetic energy as the go-between. Yet in this process angular momentum is conserved, so how exactly do bodies lose energy in this process? This project explores the fundamental physics of accretion, especially disks, and makes some forays into simulations of accretion disks.

#Week by Week Plan :
## Week 1: Studying Fundamental Processes in Accretion and Solving Differential Equations Numerically

**Textbook:**

* *Frank, King and Raine – Accretion Power in Astrophysics; Chapters 1,2 and 4*
* *Longair - High Energy Astrophysics; Chapter 14*

**PPTs:**

* *Lectures by Andrew King*

**Programming Tasks:**

* Apply the Finite Difference Method and Euler Method to solve ODEs; e.g : motion of a projectile under gravity
* Solve the Diffusion Equation in Python; e.g : start from a central density with reflective/absorbing walls and evolve over time
* Find, explain, and simulate a simple fluid mechanics problem

---

## Week 2: Accretion Disks

* Types of disks
* Radiation processes
* Origin of instabilities

---

## Week 3: Simulation Work

* Simulating a diffusion model of accretion disks
* Flux freezing in plasmas

---

## Week 4: Public Code Utilization

* Using publicly available codes to simulate accretion disks
* Analyzing outputs

# Instructions for Mentees:
1) Create a private fork of this repo and create a folder with your name on it
2) Add all your week-wise theory summary reports, jupyter notebooks and other submission items 
3) Submit a pull request so that I may merge your *completed* weekly submissions onto the main branch
4) The code, example problems and summaries should be your own and not copied from anyone else
